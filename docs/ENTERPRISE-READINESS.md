# Build Oracle Enterprise Readiness

Build Oracle is the forecasting engine of the build/Project Telos family: a
dependency-light, deterministic time-series library that turns forecasting
into reproducible, inspectable results. It is designed to be used alone as a
library or CLI, and as a component other flagships in the Build family
depend on.

## Enterprise role

- Fit and forecast with ARIMA, VAR (multivariate), Prophet-style additive
  decomposition, a NumPy-only neural forecaster, and a dynamically weighted
  ensemble of those models.
- Detect structural breaks (PELT changepoint detection), decompose series
  into trend/seasonal/residual, and engineer statistical/temporal/frequency
  features from raw series.
- Update forecasts incrementally as new observations arrive without a full
  model refit (`streaming.StreamForecaster`).
- Keep the numeric core free of heavy or network dependencies, so it installs
  and runs in constrained and offline environments.

## Operator surface

- `build-oracle` CLI for scriptable forecasting operations (`forecast`,
  `decompose`, `changepoints`, `features`, `gui`).
- The importable Python API (`build_oracle.arima`, `.var`, `.prophet`,
  `.neural`, `.ensemble`, `.streaming`, `.changepoint`, `.decompose`,
  `.features`, `.metrics`) for embedding in pipelines.
- An optional PyQt6 workbench (`pip install ".[gui]"`) for interactive
  inspection of forecasts, decompositions, and changepoints.

## Reproducibility and provenance

- Fitting and prediction are deterministic functions of their inputs (and,
  where randomness is used — e.g. neural weight initialization — an explicit
  seed), which makes results reproducible and diffable across runs and
  machines.
- Saved model artifacts (`--save` / `--load` in the `forecast` command) are
  the durable output; they can be re-generated from the same input series.
- When used inside Project Telos, forecasting operations and their outputs
  can be referenced by content hash rather than carrying raw series data
  through every context window.

## Dependencies and boundary

- **Runtime core:** `numpy` and `scipy` only. No network, no code evaluation.
- **Optional:** `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, `matplotlib` (analysis conveniences)
  and `PyQt6` (GUI). Each is isolated behind an extra so the core stays
  minimal.
- The GUI and CLI consume the core; they are never a dependency of it.

## Quality gates

- `ruff check .` (style), `mypy` (types — the numeric core is type-clean; the
  GUI adapter is boundary-typed per the overrides in `pyproject.toml`), and
  `pytest` run in CI on every push and pull request.

## Honest limits

- Forecasts are statistical estimates conditioned on the input series and
  each model's assumptions (stationarity for ARIMA, additive seasonality for
  the Prophet-style model, linear lag structure for VAR). None of them is a
  guarantee of future behavior; validate against a holdout set with the
  metrics in `metrics.py` before relying on a forecast.
- Changepoint detection and decomposition are diagnostic tools, not causal
  explanations — a detected changepoint marks a statistical shift in mean,
  not a confirmed real-world event.
- The optional pandas/scikit-learn/matplotlib/GUI layers inherit the
  maturity and advisories of those packages; the guarantees above describe
  the numpy/scipy-only core.
